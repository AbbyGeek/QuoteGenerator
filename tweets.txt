“good” morning
my life is totally destroying my life
it’s 5 AM in LA and i’ve been up all night because my dog has never before heard the sound of wind AMA

ta;dr  too annoying didn’t read
if you can’t handle me in my acute panic attack then you don’t deserve me in my general sense of persistent underlying doom
just thought “i hope you miss my pussy” and then “should i tweet that?” and then “no”

had a sex dream about panda express
there is so much to be grateful for, like not being at a writers’ conference
i’m cool when i’m alone
i’m cool when i’m alone

too tired to reclaim my power or whatev
capitalism is making me want to vomit and also buy stuff
me: fuck authority  also me: can somebody just tell me what to do

catastrophic thinking &amp; fear of the future, crushes on strangers &amp; blaming myself for everything, these are a few of my favorite things
i’m not sure what my worldview is but i know it’s not great
fleeing reality in horror like a boss
if i can’t torture myself about it i don’t want to be involved
pretending you are interesting because i need someone to obsess about
i can already tell that my fate is going to suck
spoiler: when people say it’s going to be ok they don’t reallllly know

in a committed relationship with insomnia
i like to blame myself for everything just in case

today’s tweets are sponsored by fear of the future, an inability to be still with myself and an inability to be still with anyone else
i never leave home without my childhood trauma

grammy for excessive sleeping
i’ve been tired for 20 years
can i interest you in being obsessed with me
maybe if i keep tweeting this my mother will have loved me unconditionally as a child
oh no i might be maturing
i thought you were deep but you were just hot and quiet: a love story
think positive!  don’t tell me what to do

i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by not getting texted back
never want to be part of any “current moment”
you need to learn how to be fake better
honk if you're sick of your own bullshit
i perceive everything as a rejection just to be safe
it’s rare when something isn’t a piece of shit
my mind is a conspiracy against myself
*whispers during sex* i should probably be back in therapy
everything is annoying

i’m not a nihilist i’m just always tired
why ft. bother?
getting out of bed is so last year
all my goodbyes are happy because i just want to get the fuck out of there
i have a headache, probably from being confronted with my own cosmic insignificance
when people are nice to me i feel guilty: a love story
i'm not moisturized, hydrated or full of self love and it's fine
i love you but i've chosen masturbation
“i’ve never come from penetration alone!” i call into the wind, before beginning my descent of mount everest
i'm either obsessing or sleeping
10 people like me me: they don't count 1 person hates me me: they are everything

comparing myself to others and losing
can you feel my desperation through the internet
i'm only obsessed with you to distract myself from death
can't tell if i'm losing it or i've lost it
am i an independent woman or just scared of everyone and isolated
your "positive energy" scares the shit out of me
i'm aware of what i'm doing but not enough to stop
i don't care what anyone thinks about me except i totally do
i mean, like if you count skittles, panda express and taco bell as antifa
like i’m basically the rose emoji #theresistance
i can’t say my “show” is good but what i can say is that it’s free, short and “anti-capitalist” bc i will never figure out how to do ads

sorry, i can’t, i’ve lost interest in things i once found pleasurable
strangely, i feel sad
could being alive be any more painful? asking for a friend
sometimes it's like "how are people so content?" and then i'm like oh yeah i'm mentally ill
one time i had a safe space but then i was born
live, laugh, love, channel existential anxiety into obsessions about bullshit, forget you are going to die, remember and be like fuck
being american is making me nauseous
no i don’t believe in myself, what do i look like someone who believes in themself?
am i an influencer yet?
would love to make new mistakes instead of the old ones
pretend you haven't forgotten about me
depression is like "i'm always here for you baby"
by happy i mean moderately depressed
good morning and welcome to the terror of being alive
things i'll never get over: -being born -adolescence -you
can you not give me hope
whenever i say yes to hanging out it's like i'm watching the word come out of my mouth in slow motion and trying desperately to stop it
but enough about me...here’s more about me
someone asked me how i was doing and i told them and it was too much
looking forward to being invisible to you again
being born is a lot of pressure
me: capitalism is a wasteful and depleting force  also me: i want like 5 new coats, a convertible and a horse
everyone seems to be blurring into one big blur of disgustingness
body type: kind of a prison for my spirit
70% off self-esteem
30% off calling everything fascist until the word no longer means anything
one thing i don't like is the way things are
it feels good to know you suck now
attempting to control an uncontrollable world through my food intake
did i happen to mention i hate everything
i was only the winning sperm because i was trying to prove something to another sperm who had ghosted me
even when i was a sperm i was like, do i have to?
i'm fine to be around people for 5 minutes or less
no therapist can prepare you for your family
excited to be socially awkward and self-conscious
it's important to give up on everything first thing in the morning
assistant to the regional manager of paranoia
turn-ons include being ignored
everything is shit
so what if i’m sexually attracted to a bag of pretzels
i pretend to be this 🌖🌵🌺  but i’m this 🥨🥨⚰️
i don’t want to die but i want the part after
thankful for mortality
trying to break up with myself
got over you but then forgot
my version of a social life is wondering if you still think about me
how depressing could it be? (very depressing)
torturing myself over things that don't matter is going ok
in space no one can hear your dumb opinion
excited to fuck up again
am i actually supposed to, like, live my life?
when you see the emptiness in everything i'll be here for you
being a disappointment to my mother is going great
brb, i'm imagining the worst
i have enough anxiety for 10 people
sorry, i can't, i'm babysitting my depression tonight
i’m basically only on there so if the end finally comes for twitter i can still get a little dopamine
ever just walk around like how am i not dropping dead right now
need to warn you that i'm going to be a disappointment
*trusts self*  ok never doing that again
year of the i'm a piece of shit
*looks in the mirror*  i feel personally attacked
the dopamine giveth and the dopamine taketh away
*sets healthy boundaries* *lights them on fire*
i’m not that special (and other things i’ve learned): a memoir
if he DMs you for sex he’s also DMing 50 other people for sex (and other things i’ve learned): a memoir
I don't feel at peace unless I'm torturing myself
where do you live?  trapped inside myself
